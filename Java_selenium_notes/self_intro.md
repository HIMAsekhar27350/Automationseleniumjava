# Self-Introduction:

# Thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
# Hi, I’m V. Hima Sekhar. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Sri Venkateswara University in Tirupati. I completed my 10+2 and 10th-grade education in my native place.
# 
# During my studies, I developed a strong interest in software testing and automation. For my final year project, I designed and implemented an automated testing suite for an e-commerce platform, specifically focusing on Safeway's website. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in tools like Selenium, Python, and Java. Additionally, I am proficient in frameworks such as TestNG and Cucumber.
# 
# I’m excited to bring my technical expertise and passion for improving software quality to your team.
# 
# Coming to my family background, I belong to a nuclear family of four members, including myself.
# 
# In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and traveling to temples.
# 
# That’s a brief summary about me. Thank you!
